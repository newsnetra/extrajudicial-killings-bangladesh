    <article class="mainarticle">

      <p>After Sheikh Hasina reascended to power more than a decade ago, Bangladesh&rsquo;s security forces killed at
        least 2,597 people in apparent extrajudicial executions, custodial torture, and by firing bullets at protesters,
        according to a Netra News analysis of data documented by Bangladeshi human rights researchers between 2009 and
        2022.</p>

      <p>If all these bodies were laid face up and side by side on the surface, they would take up about one-third of
        Bangabandhu National Stadium&rsquo;s football field. This visualisation, harrowing as it is, does not
        encapsulate the full scope of the tragedy because the figure is almost certainly an undercount.</p>

      <p>A vast majority of these killings come across as deliberate and targeted, as security forces often carried them
        out after having the subjects in custody. This pattern amounts to a crucial element in determining their
        illegality.</p>

      <p>The dataset was compiled by Bangladeshi human rights defenders and collated by the Australia-based&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.cpjp.org.au/resources/bangladesh">Capital Punishment Justice Project</a>. The majority of
        the cases in the dataset cited press reports, which predominantly relayed &mdash; and were confirmed by &mdash;
        the accounts of the security forces. Only a select few were investigated firsthand by field workers.</p>

      <p>Netra News neither undertook nor conducted individual investigations into each case. However, our researchers
        independently verified more than 98% of the cases in the dataset using press reports and subsequently updated
        any incomplete data. We could not verify 49 cases because the news outlet cited to have reported those cases no
        longer maintains an archive.</p>

      <p>Regular units of Bangladesh Police boast about 59% of the total body counts, the analysis shows, as well as a
        majority of those that appear to be extrajudicial executions. Another arm of the police, its elite and deadliest
        unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), is responsible for 27%. Together, all police units account for over 90%
        of all documented extrajudicial killings.</p>

      <p>Our analysis also shows that the number of killings sharply increased around the national elections held in
        2014 and 2018, widely criticised as&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/world/asia/matriarchs-duel-for-power-threatens-to-tilt-bangladesh-off-balance.html">one-sided</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/02/bangladesh-election-abuses-need-independent-probe">rigged</a>. The
        location-wise analysis reveals, among other things, a disproportionate hit on electoral districts known as
        opposition strongholds as well as the widespread targeting of the Rohingya refugees during a Duterte-style
        &ldquo;war on drugs&rdquo; between 2018 and 2019.</p>

      <p>Previous governments, such as those led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), now in the opposition, as
        well as an interim technocratic regime that ran the country from 2007 to 2009, were accused of carrying
        out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/bangladesh1206/4.htm">campaigns of extrajudicial
          executions</a>. However, the killings appear to have surged during Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s ongoing tenure,
        averaging around 200 per year.</p>

      <p>Hasina&rsquo;s reign has taken an increasingly authoritarian turn in recent years, with substantial opposition
        to her government virtually quashed. Once hailed as a moderate Muslim democracy, Bangladesh is now ranked as a
        variant of autocracy by widely respected indexes such as&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/bangladesh/2022-04-29/bangladeshs-quiet-slide-autocracy">V-Dem</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
          href="https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-dashboard/BGD">Bertelsmann Stiftung</a>. In the upcoming
        election scheduled early next year, the opposition is all but unlikely to take part due to fears of a repeat of
        the previous flawed elections.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://netra.news/2023/executioners-speak-how-to-carry-out-an-execution/">a recent
          investigation</a>&nbsp;by Netra News and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVxG7K1PGHM">Deutsche
          Welle</a>, the German public broadcaster, two former RAB commanders admitted to carrying out deliberate
        murders and implicated the highest levels of the Bangladesh government in some of them, and revealed the
        RAB&rsquo;s modus operandi when it does so.</p>

      <p>In 2020, after local police killed a former military officer in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, which in earlier two years
        witnessed hundreds of alleged extrajudicial killings during an anti-drug drive,&nbsp;<a

          confidential memorandum</a>&nbsp;authored by military intelligence and leaked to Netra News said the local
        police engaged in what it described &ldquo;a killing competition.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>In December 2021, the United States government imposed economic and other&nbsp;<a
          href="https://netra.news/2021/us-government-sanctions-rab-bangladesh-police-chief/">sanctions</a>&nbsp;against
        RAB and several of its current and former commanders over reports of its involvement with numerous extrajudicial
        killings. Rights groups&nbsp;<a

      <h2>The Agents of Death</h2>


      <p>In addition to carrying out more than half of the 2,597 killings recorded, regular police units participated in
        joint operations with other units or forces, such as RAB and the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), killing an
        additional 142 people.</p>

      <p>In total, police officers were implicated in more than 1,600 deaths &mdash; of which 74% were classified by
        none other than the police as &ldquo;gunfight&rdquo; or &ldquo;crossfire&rdquo; deaths, widely used euphemism
        for extrajudicial executions. Of the 2,095 killings that appear to be targeted executions, regular police units
        alone were responsible for 1,191 or 56%, as well as dozens of others in collaboration with other agencies.</p>

      <p>RAB, which is formally part of the police force but operates with&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;autonomy, has an
        exclusive body count of more than 700. In joint operations with regular police or other agencies, RAB officers
        participated in the killings of about 100 more. Although regular police single-handedly killed more than double
        than RAB, the elite unit&rsquo;s propensity for killings is more pronounced.</p>

      <p>The police force is 16 times larger than RAB in staff size, but its&nbsp;<em>kill count</em>&nbsp;is only 2.1
        times greater than RAB&rsquo;s. This implies that on a per capita basis, RAB&rsquo;s killing rate is eightfold
        compared to regular police. In addition, a staggering 95% of deaths attributed to RAB carry signs of being
        premeditated executions, in contrast to the police&rsquo;s 74%.</p>

      <p>Another deadly actor is the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), the military-run agency responsible for securing the
        country&rsquo;s border. Members of the border forces killed 141 people in solo operations. About a hundred of
        the deceased appear to have been in BGB&rsquo;s custody before they were killed. Joint operations that BGB
        participated in caused an additional 70 deaths.</p>

      <h2>Ballots &amp; Bullets</h2>

      <p>Since the Awami League&rsquo;s return to power in 2009, Bangladesh has conducted national elections twice, in
        2014 and 2018, both mired in controversies.</p>

      <p>The 2014 elections were boycotted by opposition parties, leaving ruling party candidates in more than half of
        the constituencies competing against none. The opposition decided to participate in the 2018 elections, but the
        Awami League clinched over 96% of the parliamentary seats, allegedly through&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/31/why-bangladeshs-landslide-election-result-is-bad-its-democracy/">massive
          rigging</a>&nbsp;operations across the country. Our analysis found that the frequency of extrajudicial
        killings sharply increased during these two election periods.</p>

      <p>In 2013, as opposition protests escalated ahead of the government&rsquo;s plan to hold a unilateral election,
        fatalities from security forces&rsquo; response quadrupled from the previous year, reaching 270.</p>

      <p>The 2013 killings also revealed a geographical pattern: Beyond Dhaka, the capital city, seven districts saw a
        double-digit death toll.</p>

      <p>Six of these districts &mdash; Joypurhat, Satkhira, Bogra, Noakhali, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, and Chittagong &mdash;
        were electoral strongholds of the opposition parties. In Joypurhat, for example, the ruling Awami League had not
        won a single constituency in the previous five elections, not even during its countrywide landslide victory in
        2008.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, the deaths in those districts had strong political undertones: many who died were affiliated
        with the opposition parties.</p>

      <p>Both the election year of 2014 and its subsequent year, 2015, witnessed persistently high casualties, tallying
        172 and 186, respectively.</p>

      <p>But no figures came close to the death toll in 2018, also an election year, which saw a two-fold increase in
        the killings compared to the average of the previous five years. With 465 deaths that year, 2018 was the
        deadliest year ever recorded as the government launched a bloody crackdown against suspected drug peddlers.</p>

      <p>The year also stands out because of its exceptionally high rate of apparently targeted, premeditated murders.

        the BNP regime when the RAB was formed in 2004.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the Chittagong Hill Tracts in eastern Bangladesh consistently experienced executions of indigenous

            <h4>Types of Killings Documented</h4>
            <p>Netra News found several themes: potentially targeted or premeditated killings of detained individuals,
              deaths resulting from law enforcement’s use of force against protests or public gatherings, fatalities
              from alleged in-custody torture, and accidental casualties.

            <h4>What qualifies as an extrajudicial killing</h4>
            <p>More than 80% — or 2,095 — of the total 2,597 killings documented in the dataset carry some signs of
              targeted murders, which we classify as clearer cases of extrajudicial executions.
            </p>

            <input type="checkbox" checked>
            <i></i>
            <h4>What About the Rest?</h4>
            <p>Experts normally adopt broader definitions of extrajudicial executions to include indiscriminate
              shootings as being such. Accordingly, many of the remaining 502 deaths, mainly resulting from the use of

            <h4>What are the biggest factors?</h4>
            <p>Of the 2,095 killings we define as extrajudicial killings, a dominant majority were carried out after the
              individuals had been admittedly or allegedly in the custody of a security force.

            <i></i>
            <h4>Do Forces Accept Responsibility?</h4>
            <p>Yes. In the cases where a security force does not dispute that the subject was in its custody beforehand,
              it tends to describe the killing as the result of a “crossfire” during a “gunfight” with the subject’s
              accomplices.

            <i></i>
            <h4>What Happens When They Don’t?</h4>
            <p>When a security force does not acknowledge having the subject under custody, it tends to claim to have
              come under unprovoked attacks from random criminals, which supposedly prompt it to respond and result in
              the death of the subject among the criminals.

      </aside>

      <p>Law enforcement agencies also reported killing a significant number of alleged members of robbery gangs. But
        approximately 28% of the total 559 killings took place in four districts adjacent to the Sundarbans: Bagerhat,
        Khulna, Barguna, and Satkhira.</p>

      <p>In 2019, a year after the government launched its anti-drug campaign, the security forces abruptly turned their
        attention to Tekanf in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar. Of the 391 deaths in Bangladesh that year, 113 victims hailed from
        this small sub-district, recognised as a major drug entry point from neighbouring Myanmar. Teknaf recorded fewer
        than 30 security force-related deaths in the preceding five years combined. Other nearby sub-districts of
        Chokoria and Maheshkhali also experienced a heightened frequency of killings in 2019.</p>

      <p>Significantly, the 2019 casualties included 59 Rohingya refugees residing in the overcrowded refugee camps of
        Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, and in the subsequent two years, another 56 Rohingya refugees met the same fate. Prior to
        2019, Rohingya refugees had rarely been killed by security forces in Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>Every one of Bangladesh&rsquo;s 64 districts witnessed fatalities, though some recorded higher numbers than
        others.</p>
      <p>Dhaka topped the list with 338 deaths. Following closely were Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, Chittagong, Kushtia, and
        Bagerhat &mdash; &nbsp;each with deaths in the triple digits. These five districts accounted for over 40% of
        total fatalities countrywide. When adjusted for population density, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar grabbed the top spot with
        around 11 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Bagerhat and Kushtia each reported over six fatalities for the same
        population count.</p>

      <p>Fifteen districts recorded single-digit deaths.</p>

      <p>Among those are Gopalganj &mdash; the Awami League&rsquo;s strongest bastion and the family home of Sheikh
        Hasina &mdash; and Kishoreganj, another party bastion that includes constituencies of two former presidents
        appointed by the ruling party. These two districts saw only seven crossfire deaths combined over the span of 13
        years.</p>

      <h2>Labels that Kill</h2>

      <p>In an overwhelming majority of the cases that fit the pattern of likely extrajudicial executions, the
        respective security forces told reporters that the victims had a criminal history.</p>

      <p>Experts have long argued that security forces leverage these negative connotations to justify their actions.
        The implication is that whether an individual was killed in a targeted operation or during a legitimate
        confrontation, they deserved their fate.</p>

      <p>The label &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was associated with about 1,200 of the cases, while the suggestion of
        &ldquo;drugs&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremism&rdquo; (either left-wing or&nbsp;<em>jihadi</em>) was present in 638 and
        192 cases, respectively.</p>


      <p>In some instances, these descriptors overlapped; for example, some individuals were labelled both as criminals
        and drug traders. We retained the label(s) that were less broad and more distinctively prominent.</p>

      <p>Between 2009 and 2017, security forces killed an average of five people annually due to alleged involvement in
        the illicit drug trade, totalling 46 deaths.</p>

      <p>However, that dramatically changed in 2018 when the government initiated its vaunted &ldquo;war on
        drugs.&rdquo; That year, the death toll related to drugs surged to 276, an alarming 54 times the prior nine-year
        average.</p>

      <p>Over the subsequent two years, another 295 individuals purportedly associated with drug trafficking were
        killed.</p>
      <p>Between 2009 and 2021, security forces killed 588 suspected dacoits. While the annual average stood at 29
        deaths until 2015, the yearly number rose significantly to 82 in 2016 and further escalated to 103 in 2018.</p>

      <p>While law enforcement agencies imply crimes as a justification for their actions, that also fits the literal
        definition of extrajudicial executions, which refers to the killings of individuals by state agents suspected of
        committing crimes without judicial due process. But what makes it worse is that security forces often appear to
        concoct stories of crimes, meaning even their purported justification was contested.</p>

      <p>In numerous cases, it is plausible that the subjects did not have any prior criminal charges. They were killed
        either because they refused to bribe the security forces, or their adversaries paid off the forces to settle
        personal scores, or due to their anti-government political position.</p>

      <p>Far from curbing crime via extrajudicial means, the security forces predictably got themselves involved in
        cold-blooded crimes. For instance, in the notorious seven-murder case in Narayanganj in 2014, the security
        forces were primarily motivated by financial gain, subsequent legal investigations would reveal.</p>

      <p>Allegations that victims were tortured to death in custody also often accompany claims that their failure to
        bribe security forces led to their deaths.</p>

      <p>Of approximately 300 instances in which the subjects appeared to have definitive links to opposition parties,
        213 were killed by indiscriminate police shooting, and 70 died in &ldquo;crossfires&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;gunfights&rdquo;. Fifty more perished in non-partisan protests or labour rallies or had ties with
        non-partisan movements.</p>
      <p>Twenty-seven individuals are documented to have died during protests led by the Hefajat-e-Islami, an Islamist
        pressure group. This count doesn’t include fatalities from Hefajat’s 5th of May rally in 2013, as
        detailed records are missing or contested.<span id="footnote-ref-3"></span><sup><a href="#footnote-3"
            class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>Roughly 192 individuals were branded as extremists, spanning both&nbsp;<em>jihadi</em>&nbsp;and left-wing
        ideologies. Such categorisation becomes especially murky since journalists rarely scrutinise its veracity, given
        the sensitivity of the subject matter.</p>


      <h2>The Official Line</h2>

      <p>Netra News has reached out to Bangladesh&rsquo;s Ministry of Home Affairs, which supervises the law enforcement
        forces, but has not received a response.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh authorities have long denied that its security forces carry out extrajudicial executions.</p>

      <p>When Michelle Bachelet, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, visited Bangladesh in 2022 and
        addressed the allegations of extrajudicial executions by the country&rsquo;s security forces, Foreign Minister
        AK Abdul Momen&nbsp;<a
          href="https://www.voanews.com/a/no-extrajudicial-killing-enforced-disappearance-in-bangladesh-bachelet-is-told-/6704801.html">responded</a>&nbsp;by
        saying that since 2008, when the Awami League government came back to power, &ldquo;there have been no reports
        of such killings in the country.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>However, as early as 2011, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&nbsp;<a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230902043716/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/pm-speaks-against-cross-fire">acknowledged</a>&nbsp;the
        actions of her forces. In February 2011, she told reporters, &ldquo;It cannot be changed overnight,&rdquo;
        referring to extrajudicial killings. &ldquo;If people had spoken out against it as fervently as they do now, the
        practice would not have persisted for so long.&rdquo;</p>

      <div class="quote-container">

          <cite class="quote-author"><span>Sheikh Hasina</span></cite>
        </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>In early April 2023, when approached for comments by Netra News and Deutsche Welle for a story on extrajudicial
        killings, Bangladesh&rsquo;s Ministry of Home Affairs responded, &ldquo;Upon receiving any such allegations, the
        ministry ensures that each incident is investigated by an independent magistrate. According to the results of
        these investigations, the claims made often lack authenticity.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>However, the magistrates are neither &ldquo;independent&rdquo; nor do they &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; the
        killings. These magistrates are junior executive bureaucrats or public servants operating directly under the
        government&rsquo;s stringent control. Multiple rights investigators have pointed out that these magistrates
        frequently rubber-stamp the so-called investigative reports even before the actual killings occur.</p>

      <p>Even then, the Bangladesh government provides no evidence to back up its own claims of conducting independent
        investigations into the allegations. For example, the reports produced by the magistrates, along with any other
        related documents (such as testimonies or interviews of involved officials), remain undisclosed, if they exist
        at all. Often, even basic information, like police and medical reports, is withheld from the families of those
        killed.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <div class="box" id="expandingBox">
          <div class="content" id="boxContent">
            <p>A local human rights group, which declined to be named in the story due to fears of the safety of its
              staff, kept track of individual cases that the Asian Human Rights Commission in Hong Kong collated in
              several spreadsheets over the years.</p>
            <p>The majority of these cases cited press reports, which predominantly relayed — and were confirmed by —
              the accounts of the security forces. Only a select few were investigated firsthand by field workers.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s essential to note that Netra News neither undertook nor feasibly could have conducted
              individual
              investigations into every case. Our analysis prioritized statements from family members and eyewitness
              reports
              over those from security agencies.</p>

            <p>However, our researchers managed to verify more than 98% of the cases
              using press
              reports separately and subsequently updated any incomplete data. In <a href="/ejk/#table1">the table</a>,
              we provided the link to the
              archived news or other reports. We could not verify 49 cases because the news outlet cited to have
              reported those cases do no longer maintain an archive.</p>

            <p>The content in the “connotation” and “identity” columns of <a href="/ejk/#table1">the table</a>
              doesn’t necessarily signify its veracity. Instead, the connotations draw from post-event statements made
              by security forces about
              the
              victims, providing readers with an insight into the justifications offered by these forces. </p>

            <p>In terms of
              recording the victims&rsquo; names, we excluded aliases and opted for fuller names.</p>

            <p>Given that Bangladesh lacks standardized address formats like ZIP codes, Netra News adapted village or
              union-level location information to match sub-district or district levels.</p>


            <p>For the mapping exercise, we
              employed
              the <code>R</code> library <code>tidyverse</code> to generate the coordinates for all sub-districts. We
              retained coordinates with a
              97%-100% confidence level, manually adjusting any outliers.</p>

            <p>To visually represent data, we segmented
              Bangladesh&rsquo;s map into numerous hex grids. These grids source data from the geo-coordinates,
              presenting
              vertical bars proportionate to the casualty count in the represented geographic region.</p>

            <p>In order to attribute casualties to specific security forces, incidents involving a single agency were
              linked
              directly to that entity.</p>


            <p>Although the RAB is technically a police unit, we treated it as a separate entity
              due
              to its de facto operational independence. Larger security forces like the police, RAB, BGB, and the army
              were
              catalogued individually. In contrast, lesser-involved forces, such as the coastguard and prisons
              department,
              were collectively categorized as &ldquo;other&rdquo;. Any incidents with the involvement of multiple
              security
              forces were labelled as &ldquo;joint&rdquo;.</p>
