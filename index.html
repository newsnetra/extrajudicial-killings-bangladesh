      <p>On the afternoon of Jan. 16, 2015, Nuruzzaman Jony called his 7-month-pregnant wife to check in on her. He had
        been hiding as police crackdown on the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) surged.</p>
      <p>“We’ll go to the doctor together later today,” he promised his wife, as he tried to compensate for two nights
        of absence at her side. “But let me go see Hira first.”</p>
      <p>Moniruzzaman Hira, his younger brother who had just returned home from a 40-day religious retreat, was picked
        up and framed in a theft case by the police. A top activist of the BNP, Jony knew that the police detained his
        apolitical brother to punish him.</p>
      <p>By late afternoon, Jony called his wife, Munia Parveen, and said he had met Hira at the prison and was ready to
        go to the doctor. That would be the last time Parveen heard from him. The next morning, Parveen would discover
        his body at the morgue of the Dhaka Medical Hospital. A police press release claimed Jonny was killed during a
        “gunfight” and that he had admitted to bombing a police outpost, a charge his family says was fabricated.</p>
      <p>At the morgue, Parveen counted the number of gunshot wounds Jony’s body sustained: 18, in total, with all but
        two in the chest. “That was a cold-blooded murder,” she said in a recent interview.</p>
      <p>Jony’s was but only one among more than 2,500 deaths caused by security forces in Bangladesh between 2009 and
        2021, according to a Netra News analysis of data gathered by rights groups over 13 years.</p>

      <p>The analysis found that a vast majority of the killings, according to family members and press reports, appear
        deliberate and targeted — often meted out after security forces had the victims under their custody. The number
        of killings sharply increased during, before, and after the national elections held in 2014 and 2018, which were
        widely condemned as unfair and fraudulent. The location-wise data also revealed the widespread targeting of the
        Rohingya refugees during a Philippines-style <a

          drugs.”</a></p>

      <p>Since coming to power in 2009, the Bangladesh government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has increasingly
        grown authoritarian: Bertelsmann Stiftung’s widely followed index put Bangladesh as a “moderate autocracy.”
        Global and domestic rights groups have long alleged that her government oversaw hundreds of extrajudicial
        killings and enforced disappearance, especially targeting her political opponents.</p>

      <p>The Asian Human Rights Commission, a Hong Kong-based regional rights organization, compiled the dataset, while
        a domestic rights group conducted field investigations. Based on press reports, which mostly cited press
        releases of security forces, the dataset documented alleged incidents of targeted killings and deaths resulting
        from gunshots fired by security forces as well as other casualties caused by alleged custodial torture.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh government routinely claims that the deaths were the result of legitimate use of force, but
        domestic and international rights organizations have long criticized the practice and called for investigations.
      </p>
      <p>In 2021, the United States government imposed economic and other sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB),
        an elite police unit, over reports of its involvement with numerous extrajudicial killings.</p>
      <p>In a recent investigation by Netra News and Deutsche Welle, the German public broadcaster, two RAB commanders
        admitted to carrying out extrajudicial killings and implicated the highest levels of the Bangladesh government
        in some of them.</p>

      <h2>Who are the perpetrators?</h2>
      <p>Of all documented cases, as many as 1,674 casualties were recorded to have taken place in individual incidents.
        The remaining 919 deaths occurred in 358 multiple-casualty incidents, where more than one person was killed.</p>
      <p>With a few probable exceptions, all victims appear to be men. The researchers were able to document the age of
        about 2,000 of the victims, 55% of whom are aged between 30 and 45.</p>
      <p>Based on the descriptions of the killings as reported in the press, Netra News categorized them into
        premeditated or targeted killings of individuals known to be in custody, deaths resulting from excessive or
        justified law enforcement response to protests or violence, deaths resulting from alleged torture of individuals
        in custody, and other seemingly accidental deaths.</p>
      <p>More than 80% — or, 2,095 — of the total 2593 killings documented in the dataset bear some hallmarks of
        targeted murders, i.e., carried out after the individuals were already in the custody of the respective security
        forces. Of the total number, 195 are allegedly torture-related casualties.</p>




      <p>The analysis also revealed unusual findings about the perpetrators of the killings.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), which is a police unit but effectively controlled by
        deputized military officers, has come under intense scrutiny for its alleged role in extrajudicial
        executions.</p>
      <p>Since its founding as a crime-busting agency in 2004, extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh have almost been
        synonymous with the RAB, as the agency engaged in deliberate lethal actions to eliminate its targets in the
        guise of “gunfights” or “crossfire.”</p>
      <p>However, the analysis reveals that non-RAB units within Bangladesh Police were collectively responsible for
        most extrajudicial executions between 2009 and 2021.</p>

      <figure class="illustrations">
        <img src="./assets/police.png" alt="An illustration of Bangladesh Police members">
        <figcaption>ILLUSTRATION by NETRA NEWS</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Regular police units carried out more than half, or 59%, of the 2594 killings recorded in this period. In
        addition, policemen participated in joint operations with other forces, including RAB and the Border Guard
        Bangladesh (BGB), resulting in the deaths of an additional 142 people. In total, police members were implicated
        in more than 1,600 deaths.</p>
      <p>Of the 2,095 killings that appear to be targeted extrajudicial executions, regular police units were
        singlehandedly responsible for 1,191 or 56%, and dozens of others in collaboration with other agencies or RAB.
      </p>
      <p>However, the regular police have a number of separate units. Although Bangladesh’s centralized state means the
        police force scattered across the country is controlled by its central headquarters in Dhaka, several units
        within the force often act with some level of autonomy and influence. One example of that is the Detective
        Branch (DB), whose members in Dhaka killed Jony. However, there isn’t sufficient data to attribute all killings
        to specific units within the police.</p>
      <p>One major exception would be RAB, which is technically under the police but enjoys operational freedom and is
        essentially outside the effective purview of the police headquarters. That means the killings by RAB were often
        publicized by its separate press office, which made it easier for researchers to attribute the killings to the
        unit.</p>
      <p>The RAB comprises members of the military forces, who dominate it, and other security and law enforcement
        agencies. The RAB’s nominal head is a senior police official, but the commanders of its operational sub-units
        are mid-ranking military officers. And when considered as a unit of a greater force, no other police unit
        surpassed the RAB in terms of killings: the unit alone carried out more than 7,00 incidents that bear the signs
        of extrajudicial executions. In addition, the elite unit led or participated in joint operations with other
        units or forces that killed about 75 people.</p>
      <p>Another major contributor is the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB). The BGB is responsible for maintaining the
        country’s border. But in recent years, the agency — led exclusively by officers deputized from the military —
        has increasingly used lethal means to eliminate seemingly premeditated targets. Members of the border forces
        killed 141 people in solo operations, 101 of whom appear to have been targeted beforehand, besides partaking in
        joint operations that caused more than 70 other lethal casualties.</p>

      <h2>Hikes in election seasons</h2>

      <p>Since 2009, Bangladesh has seen two elections, respectively, in 2014 and 2018. Both elections were married by
        controversies. Opposition parties boycotted elections in 2014, leading the ruling party to win largely
        uncontested. The 2018 election, while participated by the opposition, saw widespread fraud: the ruling party won
        more than 96% of the parliamentary seats in a North Korea-esque brazen rigging.</p>
      <p>During and in the aftermath of both elections, targeted and indiscriminate killings saw a sharp rise, the
        analysis shows.</p>

        <h3 class="peopleyeartitle">The 2013 Killing Spike</h3>
        <div class="peopleyeardescription">
          In 2013, when opposition parties waged a protest against the repeal of the caretaker government system, with
          Jamaat-e-Islami supporters pursuing a desperate, if violent, strategy to torpedo the war crimes tribunal,
          which sentenced its top leaders to death, the security forces responded
          with lethal use of force, killing as many as <b style="background:#de2d26;">173</b> people
          linked to the opposition parties. In contrast, only <b style="background:gray; color:black; ">six</b> people

      <p>In 2013, when the opposition began its protests over elections that would take place a year later, security
        forces killed 270 people, four times the number of those killed in the previous year. Both in the election year
        of 2014 and in the immediate post-election year of 2015, when the BNP and its allies attempted to revive
        election protests, Bangladesh saw a high level of lethal casualties by security forces: 172 and 186,
        respectively.</p>

      <p>The trend continued until 2017: From 2013 to 2017, security agencies killed 192 people a year on average.
        However, the executions again saw an even sharper increase in 2018, also an election year, when the government
        launched the so-called war against drugs.</p>
      <p>The year 2018 was also the deadliest recorded: as many as 465 people were killed by security agencies, an
        increase of 242% compared to the previous 5-year average. The trend slowed down in the following two years,
        which were still marked by high numbers of casualties: 391 and 223, respectively.</p>

        height="750px"></iframe>

      <p>What was also extraordinary about the 2018 period was the fewer number of protest-related non-targeted
        killings. In 2013, only 73 of the 270 people, or about 27% of those killed at the hands of security forces,
        appeared targeted or premeditated. (The 2013 figures do not include those allegedly killed during the May 5th
        rally by Hefazat-e-Islam, due to ambiguities surrounding the number and identities of the victims. Had they been
        included, the share of the targeted killings would be even less.)</p>

      <p>In contrast, 457 of 465 people, or more than 98% of those killed by security forces in 2018, appear targeted,
        meaning the victims had been apprehended before they were killed. A similar trend can be observed in 2019 and
        2020, too.</p>

      <h2>Location-wise and ethnographic trends</h2>



      <p>A year-by-year analysis of the locations where the killings took place also revealed astonishing findings. As
        Bangladesh doesn’t have a standardized address or location format, the analysis refined the location data to the
        sub-district level.</p>
      <p>Until 2018, the killings appeared scattered around the entire country, barring some regional trends. In the
        early years of the Awami League government, some localities in western and southwestern Bangladesh, covering the
        Khulna division, saw the killings of those allegedly associated with armed leftist groups.</p>

      <p>In eastern Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts also witnessed a steady number of extrajudicial killings of
        indigenous men, allegedly tied with regional political and armed organizations. Many of those killings were
        carried out by the army, which has had a longstanding presence in the area.</p>
      <p>However, in 2019, a year after the government announced its anti-drug campaign, everything began to change in
        the southernmost sub-district of Tekanf in Cox’s Bazar.</p>
      <p>113 of the 391 people killed in Bangladesh that year lived in the tiny sub-district, widely known as a drug
        entry point from neighboring Myanmar, whereas prior to 2019, the sub-district recorded fewer than 30
        police-related deaths from 2013. Other sub-districts in Cox’s Bazar, such as Chokoria and Maheshkhali, were also
        disproportionately affected during that period.</p>
      <p>Among those killed in 2019 are also 59 Rohingya refugees who lived in squalid refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. In
        2020 and 2021, 56 other Rohingya refugees were killed, too. Prior to 2019, not a single Rohingya refugee was
        killed by security forces in Bangladesh.</p>

      <h2>Attribution to “crimes”</h2>

      <p>In an overwhelming majority of the cases, the respective security forces told journalists that the victims were
        criminals or facing criminal charges. The connotation of “crime” was used in 1193 of the cases, while the
        insinuation of “drugs” or “extremism” (both left-wing or Islamist) appeared in 638 and 192 cases,
        respectively.</p>

      <p>Experts have long argued that security forces use these negative connotations to justify their actions in the
        eye of the public.</p>
      <p>In several notable cases, including the infamous 7-murder case in Narayanganj in 2014, the motives of the
        security forces were simply financial extortions. In others, they were found to be politically motivated. But
        the sweeping classification of “crime” means that it’s almost impossible to learn why these individuals were
        actually targeted. That’s in part because the press reports of the killings almost exclusively relied on the
        security force’s narratives, which, more often than not, were contended by family members.</p>
      <p>In 290 cases, there were clearer political implications. That was possible because the victims were known
        members of opposition political parties or even the ruling party, or were killed in political protest rallies.
      </p>

      <h2>Methodologies</h2>

      <p>The AHRC compiled the data in multiple spreadsheets over the years. Except for a few cases, the data cited
        newspaper sources, some of which Netra News researchers corroborated and updated. Based on respective press
        reports, researchers also updated other key details specific to the cases.</p>
      <p>Information in the “connotation” and “identity” columns of the table is not meant to represent factual
        accuracy. Connotations are based on what security forces said post-facto about the victims. They are meant to
        give the audience a sense of what justifications the security forces use in carrying out executions.</p>
      <p>As Bangladesh does not maintain ZIP codes or other standardized address formats, Netra News re-formatted
        village or union-level location data into sub-districts or districts.</p>
      <p>Netra News did not — and could possibly not — independently investigate each and every case individually.
        However, many of the cases mentioned in the dataset, such as Jony’s, are well known to be extrajudicial
        executions, and they bear the traits of one. In the case of conflicting statements, the analysis gave the
        statements from family members precedence.</p>
      <h2>What does the government say? </h2>
      <p>Although Bangladesh authorities have consistently denied that its security forces routinely carry out
        extrajudicial killings, its claims often fly in the face of reality, let alone meriting serious
        considerations.</p>
      <p>In early April, in response to a request for comment by Netra News and Deutsche Welle, Bangladesh’s Ministry of
        Home Affairs, which oversees law enforcement forces, said, “[o]n receipt of any such allegation the Ministry
        duly investigate[s] each incident by an independent Magistrate. According to the investigation reports, the
        allegation made appears not to be authentic.”</p>
      <p>However, the magistrates are neither “independent” nor do they “investigate” the killings. The magistrates are
        junior executive bureaucrats or public servants under the strict control of the government, and, according to
        multiple rights investigators, they often sign off the so-called investigative reports before the killings even
        take place.</p>
      <p>Even then, the Bangladesh government provides no evidence to back up its own claims of conducting independent
        investigations into the allegations. The magistrate’s investigative reports or any other documents (such as
        testimonies or interviews of involved officials) are not publicly available. In many cases, even routine details
        are kept hidden from relatives or family members. In Jony’s case, his wife says, she was unable to obtain basic
        documents related to the killing for years, including the medical postmortem report and the first information
        report related to the death of her husband.</p>
      <p>“For years, I could not even prove that Jony actually died,” she said.</p>
